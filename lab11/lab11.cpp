/*Game Set Up
The game will be set up with a number range from 0 to 21
A variable 'x' will be defined to randomly select a value between those numbers

Game Play
The player will make a guess based on what number they believe it is
If the player guesses correctly then the game will end and the word "Congratulations!" will appear on the screen
If the player guesses incorrectly they will lose one point from ten and have nine more turns to guess
also when the player guesses incorrectly either the word "higher" will appear on screen indicating for the player to guess a number above their original guess, 
or the word "lower" will appear indicating for them to guess a number below their original guess
After ten turns if the player has not guessed correctly they will have lost all ten points, "You Lose" will appear on screen, and the game will reset with a new number
